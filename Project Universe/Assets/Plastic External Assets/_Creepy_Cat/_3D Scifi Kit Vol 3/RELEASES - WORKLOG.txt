Update 1.15 :
-------------

Hi guys! I hope you like this new release!

- I reworked on the Red Planet map! And the rover scene :)
- Included a new mars seamless terrain, some new props etc...
- Biodome added.
- Big crane with wheel included.

- A spaceship rocket like Space X :) I don't do the interior due to lack of time, i'll see this
  in another release (if you need to make space rocket interior view, use the prefab : P_Escape_Pod_01)

- Note important : If anybody working with HDRP can report me by mail is the prefab called:
  P_Floor_01_C (working good with HDRP about alpha map, because i'm using alpha decals)
  
  It should be really appreciated!

Update 1.14 :
-------------

Hey guys! Here is the 1.14 update :) I've always found the terrains i provided really ugly...

But making a terrain is one of the really boring things to do, and in the flow of everything
i had to do in the kit (and elsewhere) I didn't have time ... I decided to include one new map
in the Scifi Kit 3! and what better than a lunar environment closed?

I hope you like it 🙂 I converted the ugly old scenes to the new ones... I will do the same
with "Red Planet" map, but i need to make a cool mars environment before! this map is one of my
coming soon package "3D Realistic Terrain Vol 1" : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5PGs1bmNaA

Update 1.10 :

Update 1.09 :
-------------

- New prefabs for holo tables and pilot chairs! I really like the rendering, look into dir: "_Update 1.09-Spaceship Infinity_R2"

- New set of holographic elements, like target / visor / planet / lines etc use this to create your own holo HUD.

- A new script that using UWeen to manage the reactors animations/particles by code! Take a look to: "SandBox_Infinity_FlyModel_B"
             
- A crappy fly model example, but it can be a good start to improve, look the scene : "SandBox_Infinity_FlyModel_A"
  But unfortunaly, i'm not enought good coder to finish it... But i want the updates if you make them, it should be cool.	

- A new script for the Walkyrie wings/cockpit/gears animations has been made, look to : "SandBox_Walkyrie_FlyModel_A"

- A new articulated screen you can stick everywhere!

- A new script to create button interactivity, take a look to : "SandBox_Interactivity_A"

- Map "Example_High_Altitude" updated.

- New metal maps! :) :) Yes, i modified them again... PBR is a real science, and understand the settings take time...
  The new rendering is a bit precise and more metalic (i know to make more metalic, but i don't want).

- Note about code scripts: I'm not coder! All you see in the kit is the better that i'm able to do (with difficulty)... 
  So, it's not perfect, i know, but it's a good start for noobs, but please, do not ask me help about code! 
  You can just ask me some questions relative to the system i made. I hope you understand the difference :)

So, do not contact me about informations / addon / upgrade of the codes, they are just provided for example and i want to stay ""low level"". If you want a better shoot system, check on the store or made it by yourself using my start base...

- Few examples called : Sandbox_XXXX are made just for you and me, to make tests into a pre made (crappy map, i know :)) but useful to create prefab or make tests.
