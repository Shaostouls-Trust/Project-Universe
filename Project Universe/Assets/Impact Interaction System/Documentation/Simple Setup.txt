-------- Installation --------
If you would like to have special icons for Impact assets and components, move the included Gizmos folder into the root of your project.

Otherwise, no special installation steps are required and you can delete the Gizmos folder if you wish. The Impact Interaction System folder can be moved anywhere in your project.

-------- Simple Setup --------
1) Create an Impact Tag Library asset
	- Create a new Impact Tag Library asset by going to Assets > Create > Impact > Impact Tag Library.
	- Fill out the fields with the tags you need. For example: Hard, Soft, Metal, Dirt, Bullet Impact, Footstep.

2) Create an Impact Material asset
	- Create a new Impact Material by going to Assets > Create > Impact > Impact Material
	- Assign a Tag Library so that you can see tag names rather than raw integer values.
	- Select one or more Material Tags for the material.
	- Create Interaction Sets so that interactions can be played when interacting with other objects
	- Set the Include Tags that will trigger the interaction set, or the Exclude Tags which will cause the interaction set to NOT be triggered.

3) Create an Audio Interaction 
	- Create an Audio Interaction by going to Assets > Create > Impact > Audio Interaction.
	- Assign Audio Clips, a template Audio Source, and set up the interaction properties.
		- The Audio Source Template must have an Impact Audio Source component attached to it.
		- Add an Impact Particles component by going to Add Component > Impact > Impact Audio Source

4) Create a Particle Interaction
	- Create a Particle Interaction by going to Assets > Create > Impact > Particle Interaction.
	- Assign the Particle Prefab. 
		- The Prefab must have an Impact Particles component attached to it.
		- Add an Impact Particles component by going to Add Component > Impact > Impact Particles.

5) Create a Decal Interaction
	- Create a Decal Interaction by going to Assets > Create > Impact > Decal Interaction.
	- Assign the Decal Prefab. 
		- The Prefab must have an Impact Decal component attached to it.
		- Add an Impact Decal component by going to Add Component > Impact > Impact Decal.

6) Assign Interactions to Impact Materials
	- Assign the Interactions from steps 3 - 5 to the Interaction Set(s) of the Impact Material(s) from step 2.

7) Add Impact Object components to your game objects.
	- Go to Add Component > Impact and choose the appropriate Impact Object component
		- Impact Object Single Material: Good for static objects.
		- Impact Object Rigidbody: For objects that have a 3D or 2D Rigidbody.
		- Impact Terrain: For terrains.
	- Assign the Impact Material(s) from step 2.

8) Add Impact Trigger components to your Impact Objects.
	- Go to Add Component > Impact and choose from 3D or 2D Collision Triggers.
		- Impact Collision Trigger: Handles single collisions (with OnCollisionEnter).
		- Impact Slide and Roll Trigger: Handles sliding and rolling (with OnCollisionStay).
		- Impact Simple Collision Trigger: Handles single collisions but does not recieve any data about collision velocity or what object was hit. Only useful if very high performance is needed.
	- Assign the Impact Object collision data will be sent to.
	- Typically only dynamic objects such as objects with Rigidbodies will need to have triggers.

Now you are ready to go!
