# Pixel Burn Effect

A package of 3 variations of a pixel burn effect made with Unity shaders. 
The first two shaders add a burn effect to sprites as well as 3D meshes. 
The third shader allows you have a mesh appear/disappear with a burn effect.

There isn't much to setup, reference the <i>Demo</i> scene provided to see each effect applied to an object.

Shader parameters exposed in the editor should give you full control over each effect.
